# Token-Sale-Event-TSE

34% of the tokens will be released continuously over 25 months. During the first ‘Launch’ month token release will be hard capped at 140 million tokens per day for the first 30 days. During the Launch month we will sell 4.2 billion tokens (10%). 20% or more of this initial launch offering (+2% overall) will be reserved for allocation to preferred stakeholders to enable a degree of preferential engagement by committed supporters. After the first 10% has been sold, we will sell a maximum of 1% per month for the next 24 months (<420 Million tokens/month) at a rate of <14 million tokens per day, after which the TSE is concluded. The TSE will be hard-capped at $30 million, to maintain token value.
 
We will use the “continuous release TSE model” to allow for continuous liquidity for the first 2 years of operations while we build Pangea and its user and contributor ecosystem. This will encourage a larger stakeholder community to emerge. Tokens will not be priced but rather hard coded to sell to the highest bidder: >97 million per minute for the first month. This is a large enough amount to encourage buyers to put their bid on the order book and eventually get their investment over time, reducing the need to rush and thus stress the Ethereum network.

In addition to the 34% sold during the TSE, 32% of tokens will be pre-allocated to founders, present and future core contributors, and early adopters (pre-TSE Bitnation Citizens). Of this allocation, 18% will be for pre-TSE contributors, Citizens and Founders, and 14% reserved for future options and bounties for the Pangea open source contributor community. A further 34% powers the software and is reserved for Citizens to earn on Pangea.
